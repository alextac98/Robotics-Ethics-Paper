\section{Long-Term (>100 years)}
\label{sec:long}

It's difficult to predict the future in 100 years, but the thought experiment is still rather interesting. Life as we know it here on Earth will almost certainly be very different than today. A study in 2008 performed by Oxford University found that there was a 19\% risk that humanity is extinct on Earth before 2100 (\cite{WeDead100Years})! While this may seem scary as we look into our future on this planet, we need to understand that no amount of research and/or predictions will generate our desired path as a society; we instead need to work collectively and help each other survive on our tiny blue dot in this vast black ocean we call space. All of this is to say this section's information is merely my speculation of 2 of the most likely possibilities rather than an accurate prediction of the future.
